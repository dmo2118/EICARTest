EICAR Anti-Malware Testfile
===========================

Let's see if GitHub has any antivirus software! (Signs point to 'no'.)

`eicar.com` is a small DOS program to test anti-virus software. It is not
dangerous, but antivirus/antimalware software should detect it as a virus, and
offer to remove it from your system. For more information, refer to
[EICAR's web site](http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm).

`eicar.com` was originally written by Paul Ducklin. EICAR does not provide legal
terms for usage or redistribution of `eicar.com`, which unfortunately puts the
file in a legal gray area. Practically speaking, `eicar.com` is widely
redistributed, apparently with no legal ramifications from either EICAR or Mr.
Ducklin. FWIW, EICAR's web site indicates that the file was designed with the
intent for it to be redistributed freely.
